# scrolling-text

Text scroller similar to the Apple Music app. [Example Video](apple-music-scrolling.mp4)

## Notes
* Animating cut off text does not work with transform, transform works on the view layer.

## TODO
* Song with long name and artist.
* If text is longer than width then start scrolling.
* If page has multiple scrollers they should end at the same time



## Tests
* Use a song with long file name.
